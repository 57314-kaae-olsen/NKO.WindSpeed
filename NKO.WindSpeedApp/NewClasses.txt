I am proud to present my new 2D Ultrasonic Anemometer. The new 2D Ultrasonic Anemometer is designed for simultaneous measurement of horizontal wind speed and wind direction parameters as well as the acoustic temperature, without use of any moving parts.

R =specific gas constant = 287.058 J / (kg · K) for dry air
